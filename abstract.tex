    The recently developed Particle-based Variational Inference (ParVI) 
    methods drive the empirical distribution of a set of  
    particles towards a given unconstrained target distribution 
    $\pi$ by iteratively updating particles' positions.
    To tackle the limitation that ParVI methods can only handle unconstrained target distributions,
    mirrored ParVI methods, e.g. mirrored SVGD method, are proposed to handle
    constrained target distributions by evolving fixed-weight particles in a dual space defined by a mirror map.
    However, the fix weight restriction in dual space greatly confines the approximation ability of
    distributions in primal space. 
    In this paper, we develop a general Mirrored Dynamic-weight Particle-based Variational Inference (MDPVI) framework 
    according to a novel continuous composite flow, which evolves the positions 
    and weights of particles simultaneously in a dual space 
    to approximate constrained target distribution efficiently. 
    We show that the mean-field limit of our composite flow is 
    actually a Mirrored-Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow of the associated dissimilarity functional. 
    By using different finite-particle approximations in our general framework, 
    we derive several efficient MDPVI algorithms. 
    The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our derived MDPVI 
    algorithms over their fixed-weight counterparts1.
