\section{Introduction}

Recently, Particle-based Variational Inference (ParVI) have drawn much attention 
in the Bayesian inference literature, due to their success 
in approximating unconstrained target distributions
    \cite{liu2016stein,liu2018riemannian,liu2018stein,pu2017vae,zhu2020variance}. 
The core of ParVIs lies at evolving the empirical distribution of $M$ \emph{fixed-weight} particles by simulating a \emph{continuity equation} 
through its easy-to-calculate finite-particle position transport approximation 
\cite{liu2019understanding}. 
However, these ParVI methods would break down for sampling constrained target, like distributions on the simplex 
or the targets of post-selection inference.
\cite{shi2022sampling} tackle this challenge by apply Stein methods to fix-weight particles in dual space defined by
a mirror map to approximate target constrained distributions in primal space.
